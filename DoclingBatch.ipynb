Both testing and debugging contribute to improving the  quality of the test object, so should really both be considered positively.

Dynamic testing does involve intentionally causing the test  object to fail, which is why some people consider it a negative activity,  but that is a very narrow view (and not one typically held by testers).  Both positive and negative test cases are possible. Positive test cases  check that the test object correctly performs what it is supposed to do,  while negative testing checks that the test object does not do what it is  not supposed to do  Is correct.

The test plan may include test data  requirements  (as part of  the test approach), but not the detailed test data for test cases. Test  data is part of the test cases, not the test plan.

One of the purposes of a test plan is to help ensure that  the performed test activities will meet the established criteria, by  including entry criteria and exit criteria.

            "| 32                      | a                 | We want to run test cases according to their priorities, but we also need to  consider the dependencies.  If we only consider priorities, we want to first run TC 5 and TC 7 (highest  priority), then TC 1, TC 3, and TC 4, and finally TC 2 and TC 6 (lowest  priority).  However, in order to run TC 7, we need to first run TC 4.  In order to run TC 5, we need to run TC 4 and TC 2, but TC 2 is blocked by  TC 1, which should be run prior to TC 2.  So, in order to run priority 1 test cases as early as possible, the first five test  cases should be: TC 4 - TC 7 - TC 1 - TC 2 - TC 5.  Next, we need to run TC 3, because it has higher priority than TC 6.  Thus the full schedule will be TC 4 - TC 7 - TC 1 - TC 2 - TC 5 - TC 3 -  TC 6.  So, the sixth test case will be TC 3.
